# Configure OpenVPN Clients

[OpenVPN clients](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) are available for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android and Linux. macOS users can also use [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net).

To add a VPN connection, first securely transfer the generated `.ovpn` file to your device, then open the OpenVPN App and import the VPN profile.

iOS (iPhone & iPad) users can refer to [this FAQ page](https://openvpn.net/faq/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-various-openvpn-settings-in-the-ios-settings-app/) to learn more about OpenVPN settings.
